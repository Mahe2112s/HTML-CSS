				The header element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
				A header element typically contains:one or more heading elements (h1-h6)
				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

				It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc

			<center><h1>Table</h1></center>
			<p>
				A table is an arrangement of columns and rows that organizes and positions data or images. Tables can be created on Wikipedia pages using special wikitext syntax, and many different styles and tricks can be used to customise them.Tables can be used as formatting instrument, but consider using a multi column list instead.

				<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>1</th>
					<th>2</th>
					<th>3</th>
					<th>4</th>
				</tr>

			<tbody>

					<td rowspan="4">1</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>3</td>

			<p>The table parameters and cell parameters are the same as in HTML,tables.html#edef-TABLE and Table (HTML). However, the thead, tbody, tfoot, colgroup, and col</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tables must not be used as layout aids. There are a variety of alternatives to using HTML tables for layout, primarily using CSS positioning and the CSS table model.</li>
				<li>Users might have difficulty understanding the content, authors should include explanatory information introducing the table. This information is useful for all users, but is especially useful for users who cannot see the table, e.g. users of screen readers</li>
				<li>Tables have rows and columns given by their descendants. A table must not have an empty row or column.</li><br>

			<center><h1>List</h1></center>
			<p>HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain −
				ul − An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.

				ol − An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.

				dl − A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary.</p>
				<h3>Unorder List:</h3>
				An unordered list is a collection of related items that have no special order or sequence. This list is created by using HTML ul tag. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet.
				<h3>Ordered List:</h3>
				If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, then HTML ordered list will be used. This list is created by using <ol> tag. The numbering starts at one and is incremented by one for each successive ordered list element tagged with <li>.

			HTML Formatting Elements
			Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

			b- Bold text
			strong - Important text
			i - Italic text
			em - Emphasized text
			mark - Marked text
			small - Smaller text
			del - Deleted text
			ins - Inserted text
			sub - Subscript text
			sup - Superscript text

				The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

				Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

				HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as  and  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and p surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

				HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element, together with JavaScript.
